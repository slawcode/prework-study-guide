       <h2>HTML</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development: HTML, CSS, and JS. 
         <li>It is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
         <li>HTML is made up of elements that perform distinct roles.</li>
         <li>It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
         <li>Though some HTML elements are visible to users, others provide important information about a HTML document and website that is used by the browser so that the page renders correctly.</li>
         <li>In addition to elements that can be seen on the page, elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.</li>
         <li>Each HTML element performs a unique role. However, two elements are especially important to understanding how the structure works: the <head> and <body> elements.</li>
         <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
         <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
         <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the <head> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage</li>
         <li>The head element is a container for metadata.</li>
         <li>Metadata is data (information) about data - metadata will not be displayed on the page. Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.</li>
         <li>Inside the head element we can use the title metadata tag. The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
         <li>The body element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
         <li>The body element defines the body of the document, which contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the content that we want to display to users must be inside the <body> element.</li>
         <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.</li>
         <li>These tags are most often represented by angle brackets (< >) with associated tag names contained inside.</li>
         <li>Closing tags begin with a forward slash (</ >).</li>
         <li>We insert the content between an opening tag and a closing tag so that the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>
         <li>The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element.</li>
         <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
         <li>When possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements, because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
         <li>Semantic HTML also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
         <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference. An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
         <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
         <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
         <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
         <li>The ul, ol and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
         <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
         <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
         <li>The footer appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
         <li>Img is an inline and empty element, which means that it doesn't start on a new line and doesn't take a closing tag.</li> 
         <li>The img tag takes several attributes, of which src, height, width and alt are the most important.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Developers use inline CSS when they want to style an element directly in the HTML file. 
          <li>The style.css file is linked within the head element in HTML (a link element goes inside the head element).</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>An example of inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading.</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The rules only apply to that page and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are acceptable methods (under certain conditions) to style a webpage.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.
          <li>When using an external style sheet link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head, for example, link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css".</li>
          <li>A special wild card symbol (*) is used to apply a rule all elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element (or attributes) that the declaration will apply to.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: property and value. For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When you increase padding you are actually making the entire element bigger.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

          <li>git pull origin main (double-check that our local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub)(We identify a Git command with the git keyword. Then use the pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository.)

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, this is JavaScript at work.
          <li>It is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. (Concepts, such as conditional logic and arrays, can be applied to many other in-demand OOP languages.)</li>
          <li>The script.js file is linked within the body element in HTML, under the footer element and above the closing body element.</li>
          <li>One of JavaScripts core features is variables, which store data types as values.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows one to store data in their code.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable use the var keyword.</li>
          <li>After the var keyword give the variable a name.</li>
          <li>Then use an assignment operator ( = ) to assign the specific data that will be stored in the variable.
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon ( ; ).</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page (top to bottom).
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however, we use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Just like its name sounds, when using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>When computers encounter an if statement in a JavaScript file it will check to see if the condition provided is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action it was asked to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition is not true, or has a value that is not truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
          <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript we can have more than one condition by using else if. Sometimes we want to provide more conditions than just if.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, etc.</li>
          <li>Strings need to be contained within quotation marks.</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array we need to have the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, then individual data can be accessed inside the array.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices (or location identifiers) will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array. It does this by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive (without deleting it) in case you need it later.</li>
          <li>To comment out lines of JavaScript code put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
          <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>When we create a function we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and giving it a unique name. However, just defining a function does not mean it will execute in our code automatically. To execute a function, we must call it in our code.</li>
          <li>Having a block of code that executes only when we call it makes the code more easily reusable because we can call it as many times as needed.</li>
