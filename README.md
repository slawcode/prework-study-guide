Boot Camp Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project was created to organize coding bootcamp prework course notes into one place. The webpage provides notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScriptt, which are each given a section. The notes them selves are from the Univerdsity of Toronto's Coding Bootcamp Prework Modules, mostly content provided in the third module. 

It is accessible through a webpage broswer so that I  can retrieve these notes anytime and quickly for reference on these four topics. The URL is placed in a web browser to access the webpage. Furthermore, the webpage does not require any authentications, like a password.
