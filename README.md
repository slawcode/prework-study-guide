# prework-study-guide

## Description

- This project was created to organize coding bootcamp prework course notes into one place. 
- The webpage provides notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScriptt, which are each given a section.
- The information is from the Univerdity of Toronto's Coding Bootcamp Prework Modules, more specifically, most content was provided in the third module. 
- Throughout the making of this webpage I encountered an issue when creating the CSS style sheet which then affected the link in HTML. As a result, I learned the importance of file names and organzing folders on my computer properly to ensure the file paths will work.

## Usage

- To use this study guide you can access the webpage by placing the URL in a browser. Furthermore, the webpage does not require any authentications, like a password. 
- There you can review notes on each of the four topics.
- If you would like suggestions on what to study first you can open Chrome DevTools. This can be done one of two ways, either by right clicking on the Prework Study Guide page and clicking Inspect or through keyboard commands. On a MacOS this is done by pressing Command+Option+I or in Windows by pressing Control+Shift+I. A console panel should open, either to the side or below the webpage. If the Console panel is not open select 'Console.' Here you will see a list of topics learned in Prework and suggestions on which topic to study first.
